#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
  - We discussed the concept of a game and gameplay, and how to define each.
  - A game is defined by gameplay, which in order to be good should have engaging, interesting, and/or meaningful interactions and choices for the player to make. Fancy visuals and graphics don't automatically makes a game or its gameplay good.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
    <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->
  - What if I remade an existing card/board game, but with a style that has never been done before?
  - Maybe it can be a game that people don't normally play, such as Pekwa, a Filipino card game, to share some of my culture to different audiences and evoke nostalgia in Filipinos who have played this game before as it's an old school card game.
    - Then maybe I can incorporate the "retro" styles I really like with the design of the game.
    - Are these enough to make it unique? Or is it necessary to add some sort of twist/modification to the gameplay?

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
