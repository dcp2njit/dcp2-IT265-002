#### Goals for this Module
- [x] Goal 1: Present prototype
- [x] Goal 2: Do more playtesting
- [x] Goal 3: Refine mechanics, more specifically rescuer upgrades
#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
Presented the prototype; Looking back I definitely could've gone over the game more concisely and in a more structured way. I just felt like there was so much I wanted to cover that I got ahead of myself and started rambling and bouncing from thing to thing without much structure. I didn't mean to take up so much class time T-T
 After doing some playtests before the presentation, I realized there are things that I need to change since right now the Rescuer seems to be at more of a disadvantage. I edited my ruleset and some of the cards I created to account for it. I nerfed some of the mutation cards that were too strong during playtesting. I also received good feedback from a friend who playtested to change the Rescuer's d6 roll energy loss to drain health when they're at 1 Energy. I also changed the d6 roll to drain health upon rolling a 1 or 6 instead of a 50/50 with odds or evens to make it more fair. I also did some additional playtesting after the presentation and realized there'll be some more changes I'll need to make.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.

After further playtesting I think I need to add a timer for turns. It'll make players more prone to make mistakes but I think that should add to the fun/chaos, and also make the fast-pased decision-making part of the challenge that players can eventually improve on.

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.

  - I want to do more playtests with my new changes and start figuring out how I'm going to approach the digital prototype.
