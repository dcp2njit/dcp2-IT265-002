#### Goals for this Module
- [x] Goal 1: Set up Godot Project
- [x] Goal 2: Begin Planning out Digital Prototype for Protocall
- [x] Goal 3: Begin familiarizing self with Godot
#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
I haven't been able to do too much as I have been busy with projects for other classes, but I am taking small steps towards the digital prototype. I created a document as a looseleaf / game design doc for the digital version of Protocall. I've been using it to take notes in class during lectures and write down any ideas/concepts that may be useful for the game. I also downloaded Godot and created the project folder for Protocall, but I want to try to familiarize myself with Godot first before starting anything on the actual game. I think I will mostly use free assets online for the isometric board, but I will try to create some on my own if time permits. I also would like to do more playtesting and balancing with rescuer vs infected upgrades. 

I started looking up videos on how to use godot and set up an isometric tilemap.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- We learned about square grids in digital games, how they're utilized and created with 2D arrays. It will be useful to create helper methods to keep track of adjacent neighbors, distance, and direction.
