#### Goals for this Module
- [x] Goal 1: Set up Godot Project
- [x] Goal 2: Begin Planning out Digital Prototype for Protocall
- [x] Goal 3: Begin familiarizing self with Godot
#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
I created a document as a looseleaf / game design doc for the digital version of Protocall. I've been using it to take notes in class during lectures and write down any ideas/concepts that may be useful for the game. I also downloaded Godot and created the project folder for Protocall, but I want to try to familiarize myself with Godot first before starting anything on the actual game. I think I will mostly use free assets online for the isometric board, but I will try to create some on my own if time permits. I also would like to do more playtesting and balancing with rescuer vs infected upgrades.

After further playtesting I think I need to add a timer for turns. It'll make players more prone to make mistakes but I think that should add to the fun/chaos, and also make the fast-pased decision-making part of the challenge that players can eventually improve on.

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.

  - I want to do more playtests with my new changes and start figuring out how I'm going to approach the digital prototype.
