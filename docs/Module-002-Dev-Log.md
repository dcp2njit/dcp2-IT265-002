#### Goals for this Module
- [x] Complete Case Study Research of Pitfall!
- [x] Read chapter of game arch & design book
- [x] Brainstorm more ideas for game

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Began research on the game Pitfall! - 2/3/25   
  - Completed the case study research of Pitfall! - 2/8/25
  - Read some of the game and arch design book - 2/8/25
  - Brainstormed a little bit more about what kind of game I want to make - 2/8/25

- **Challenges faced**:
  - N/A
- **Solutions**:
  - N/A

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
  -  Game Balance
    - We learned about the importance of balanced design in games and the three types of balance: player/player balance, player/gameplay balance, and gameplay/gameplay balance. Balance is important for ensuring fairness and providing players with a fun and rewarding experience.
    - Strategies shouldn't be too dominating so that all choices can feel viable
  -   Pitfall!
    - I learned a lot about Pitfall!, its history, and its impact on the gaming industry. It's so interesting to see how a game that would be regarded as super simple and limiting in modern day was regarded as game-changing and revolutionary in terms of game design.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
  - If i were to make the game pekwa, I wouldn't be able to make it multiplayer, so I guess I would have to make AI opponents for the single player to play against?
  - Maybe there can be power up / wild cards to spice up the gameplay?
  - I think I want to do a frutiger aero / windows xp theme for the game, with hints of filipino culture hidden within the desktop, design, and gameplay
<!--

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  
-->

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
  -  I should definitely read the book some more, and come up with more ideas for the game I want to make for this class.
