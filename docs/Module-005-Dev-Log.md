#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
  - We discussed the concept of a game and gameplay, and how to define each.
  - A game is defined by gameplay, which in order to be good should have engaging, interesting, and/or meaningful interactions and choices for the player to make. Fancy visuals and graphics don't automatically makes a game or its gameplay good.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
    <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->
  - After looking into it more I think the idea to use Pekwa isn't going to be as viable as I thought it would be, especially since it is typically played with more than 2 players
  - Another card game I started looking into is Spit.

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
