    - Completed Color Theory Case Study assignment 2/22
    - Looked over slides for game mechanics and color theory to help with assignment - 2/22
- **Challenges faced**:
  - N/A
- **Solutions**:
  - N/A

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
  - Learned about color theory and game mechanics. The importance of choosing certain color schemes and how they can affect a game's look and feel. The different kind of games and the mechanics that define the genres, as well as how they each uniquely and similarly reward and engage players.
  - The case study really solidified the concept of color theory being used in games and the various impacts it has.

#### Free Thinking
- N/A
#### Next Steps
- I need to start thinking harder about what kind of game I want to make and solidify some ideas.
