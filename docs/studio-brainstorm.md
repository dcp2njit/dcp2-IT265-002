- **Chosen Name**:
  - Retrojunk Studios
  
- **About the name**:
  - Retrojunk is a name I came up with back in 2015 for a Roblox clothing group I ran with 2 of my close friends. I really liked the name because I'm really big on things that evoke nostalgia, hence the use of "retro". The word "junk" holds a lot of different meanings to me: 1. It's a cute word, so is the word retro, 2. I'm the type of person that gets sentimental about items most people would consider junk, and 2. I personally never really think most of the stuff I make is that good so it makes me feel better to preface my creations with the word "junk" being in the studio name.
