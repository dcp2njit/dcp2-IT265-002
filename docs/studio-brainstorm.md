- **About the name**:
  - Retrojunk is a name I came up with back in 2015 for a Roblox clothing group I ran with 2 of my close friends. I really liked the name because I'm really big on things that evoke nostalgia, hence the use of "retro". The word "junk" holds a lot of different meanings to me: 1. It's a cute word, so is the word retro, 2. I'm the type of person that gets sentimental about items most people would consider junk, and 2. I personally never really think most of the stuff I make is that good so it makes me feel better to preface my creations with the word "junk" being in the studio name.

## Unique Selling Point (USP)
*What will make your games stand out from others, particularly in the indie/board game space?*

  > The combination of nostalgic styles/aesthetics with the inspired board/card game
  > If I were to use the old school Filipino card game Pekwa, I think that alone would make it stand out as it's a card game not really known by the general public. Integrating a game like with aesthetics that take inspiration from either a certain era or style may stand out even more.
