#### Goals for this Module
- [x] Goal 1: Decide on a Studio Name
- [ ] Goal 2: Come up with a list of board games / card games to take inspiration from
- [x] Goal 3: Complete Brainstorm Document

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Decided on a studio name and completed a good chunk of the brainstorm document - 1/24/25
  - Did not create full list of games to take inspo one, but I chose one I'm leaning towards which is the card game Pekwa.
  - Completed Brainstorm Document - 1/27/25

   <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Having some difficulty settling on a particular style to follow through with, both in terms of visual and game design
     <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->
- **Solutions**:
  - Going to have to list out my options and do process of elimination in terms of uniqueness and scope.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
  - We discussed the concept of a game and gameplay, and how to define each.
  - A game is defined by gameplay, which in order to be good should have engaging, interesting, and/or meaningful interactions and choices for the player to make. Fancy visuals and graphics don't automatically makes a game or its gameplay good.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
    <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->
  - What if I remade an existing card/board game, but with a style that has never been done before?
  - Maybe it can be a game that people don't normally play, such as Pekwa, a Filipino card game, to share some of my culture to different audiences and evoke nostalgia in Filipinos who have played this game before as it's an old school card game.
    - Then maybe I can incorporate the "retro" styles I really like with the design of the game.
    - Are these enough to make it unique? Or is it necessary to add some sort of twist/modification to the gameplay?
<!--  
- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  
-->

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
