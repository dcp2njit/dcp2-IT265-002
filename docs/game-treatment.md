## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Primary Mechanics

- **Turn-based Movement and Actions**
  - Player has a limited number of Action Points (AP) per turn for movement and other actions.
- **Dice Rolling for **Randomization****
  - Randomized coordiantes for distress calls
  - Hazardous encounters - Dice roll (or coin flip) for deciding the outcomes of risky actions (engaging with zombies and other hostiles, navigating/looting dangerous terrain, etc.)
- **Resource Management System**
  -  Action Points - spendable points that replenish (+2/3) each turn, can be stacked if points arent all used at end of turn.
      - Used for movement - consumes mech fuel and AP
      - Used for actions -  consumes energy and AP
  -  Health - player's physical condition;
      -  -health for bad encounters with zombies/hazards
      -  +health for consuming medkits
  -  Energy - player's physical stamina and capacity to perform risky/physically demanding actions
      - -energy when rescuing survivors, engaging in combat, or looting hazardous areas
      - +energy for consuming food, resting in safe areas, etc
  -  Fuel - primary resource for movement, reaching 0 before answering all distress calls = loss
  -  Supplies - consumable items
      -  Medkit: +health -AP
      -  Food: +energy -AP
      -  Fuel: +fuel -AP
  -  Inventory - The mech has 6 inventory slots, which can be occupied by food, medkits, fuel, and survivors.
      - As you rescue survivors, your available slots will decrease
      - If your inventory is full but you have an option to loot, you may discard an item to replace it with your new loot  

 
- **Card Decks**
    -  Event Cards
      - Draw 1 every turn
        - random cards that vary between helpful/harmful events that can sometimes present players with a choice or subject them to encounter/experience something they have no choice over. 
    - Rescue Cards
      - Upon reaching distress call location, draw 1 rescue card to determine the profile the of survivor, the scenario, and any potential benefits or detriments they may add (addition/consumption of resources, etc.)
    - Hazard Cards
      - can be drawn upon
        - landing on a coordinate with a yellow caution symbol at the end of a turn
        - choosing to take the subway system
        - being prompted to draw a hazard card by another card
<!-- 
List and describe the core gameplay mechanics players will engage with. 
Explain how they contribute to the game's challenge and fun. 
-->

- Movement System
  - The board is an isometric 6x6 city grid with X and Y coordinates
  - Distress Call locations are determined by **TWO** d6 dice rolls;
    - 1 roll for X-coordinate
    - 1 roll for y-coordinate
  - Player moves are turn-based
    - Moving on the grid costs **Action Points** and **Fuel**
      - Moving straight in any direction costs 1 AP and 1 fuel
      - Moving diagonally costs 2 AP and 1 fuel
  - Mech can be upgraded if a survivor posesses the skill to do so.
    - consumption of action points, energy, and an extra turn, but is an investment that can mean less fuel/AP consumption for larger moves in future turns


### Goals and Challenges
<!-- 
Detail what players aim to achieve and the obstacles they must overcome. 
Explain how these challenges drive player engagement. 

-->
Goals:
- Primary Goal: Successfully answer 3 distress calls by rescuing survivors and returning them back to HQ before mech fuel or player health runs out.
- Secondary Goals:
  - Optimize routes between distress calls to preserve fuel and/or energy 
  - Manage resources as efficiently as possible
  - When prompted by random events/encounters, think critically and choose the most optimal decisions

Challenges:
- Limited turns - Limited turns simulates the time constraint and sense of urgency of the player's situation, prompting them to make strategic moves and decisions. 
- Scare resource management - managing limited Action Points(AP), fuel, health, and supplies forces strategic choices
- Dynamic Hazards - Unpredictable events and encounters with zombies, hostile survivors, stractural hazards create dangerous obstacles for players to navigate and adapt to.
- Risk vs. Reward Decisions -You can rescue and drop off survivors in bulk, or one by one, or a mix of both. Choosing which, when, and how to rescue and drop off survivors is difficult considering the significant impact it has on resource consumption and exposure to hazards.

### Progression
<!-- 
Describe how the gameplay evolves over time. 
Are there new abilities, unlockable levels, skill trees, or difficulty scaling? 
-->
- Difficulty scaling -
  - As more survivors are saved, the player has less inventory slots making supplies even scarcer and difficult to manage
  - With each survivor saved, the deduction values hazard cards and negative events increase by 1.
    - Ex: If an encounter gives -2 health with 0 survivors rescued. then having:
      - 1 survivor = -3 health
      - 2 survivors =  -4 health
      - 3 survivors = -5 health
- Mech upgrades - consumption of action points, energy, and an extra turn, but in turn can mean less fuel/AP consumption for larger moves in future turns
- 


### Game Rules
<!-- 
Outline the core rules governing the gameplay experience. 
Ensure they are clear, structured, and intuitive. 
-->
Board Setup
- Choose your starting position (either at HQ or through 2 dice rolls) and place your Player Piece on the board
- Deterimine distress call locations with 2 dice rolls and place the Survivor Piece on the board
  - Repeat 2 times for the remaining survivors.
- The board is static with fixed positions for important locations

1. Players start with **!0 Health, 10 Energy, 12 Fuel,**
2.  
3.

Survivors - A diverse range of individuals that the protagonist can encounter when answering a distress call. Their profiles (determined by Rescue Cards) range from skilled technicians to injured civilians.
