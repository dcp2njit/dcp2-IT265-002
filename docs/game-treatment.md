## Title
- Protocall

A play on the words "Protocol" and "Call". Considering the protagonist of the game is a first-responder trying to rescue survivors sending out distress signals/calls, I felt it made sense to mix the words together to make the title something unique that also fits the theme and Rescuer's objective.

<!--

## Concept Statement

PROTOCALL is a tense, asymmetrical survival board game where one player pilots a resource-strained rescue mech through a hazard-ridden city to extract survivors broadcasting distress signals, while the other controls mutating zombies intent on stopping them in their tracks.

Mention any sub-genres if applicable. 
-->

### Style

Dark, muted color palette for the environment to match the tone of the setting, with - a post-apocalyptic city with urban decay and overgrowth, crumbling infrastructure, and desperate survivors seeking rescue


Isometric / pixelated (for digital) 
Physical - 3D modeled or printed with illustrations



<!-- 
Describe the tone, visual approach, and gameplay feel. 
Examples: "A dark, gothic horror with hand-drawn 2D animation" or 
"A lighthearted, comedic party game with vibrant colors and exaggerated physics."

- The game will include multiple difficulties to appeal to newbies, casuals, and hardcore players.
There will be a gradual learning curve, as the initial survivor will always be the easiest to help introduce and familiarize the player with the resource management, dice, and card mechanics before it becomes increasingly difficult.
- The game rules will be written out to be referred to at any time and the game will not be super rigid, meaning players can alter the game rules as they like to play it how they want, or adjust it to be both easier or challenging.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Primary Mechanics

<!-- 
List and describe the core gameplay mechanics players will engage with. 
Explain how they contribute to the game's challenge and fun. 
-->



### Goals and Challenges
<!-- 
Detail what players aim to achieve and the obstacles they must overcome. 
Explain how these challenges drive player engagement. 

-->
**The Rescuer**

**Objective:** reach each distress signal location and bring 3 survivors back to HQ one at a time. If either resource is depleted before 3 survivors are rescued, the Rescuer fails the mission and loses the game. If the Rescuer manages to bring all 3 survivors back without dying or having their mech run out of Energy they win the game.

**Challenges:** The Rescuer starts with 10 Health and 10 Energy, which they must maintain throughout the entire game. These resources can be lost through combat and hazards, or gained through loot, random encounters, and upgrades. They may lose -1 Energy (determined by a D6 roll) to recharge their mech. Encountered hazards (from tile outcomes) and attacks from the Infected are also challenges that deplete their Health and Energy, which they must consider and adapt their strategy to. Sometimes they will need to make a difficult decision, and other times they have no choice but to deal with what's happening.

**The Infected**

**Objective:** prevent the successful extraction of the survivors by exhausting the Rescuer’s Health or Energy before all 3 are returned to HQ. 

**Challenges:** The Infected has 3 Zombie units to manage and control instead of 1. Instead of having a Health resource, they immediately die upon being attacked by the Rescuer, respawning on their next turn. This can either be a challenge or useful depending on the circumstances and how the Infected chooses to play. 

Both the Rescuer and the Infected will be granted upgrades as the game progresses, which will pose further challenges to each side and escalate the gameplay.




### Progression
<!-- 
Describe how the gameplay evolves over time. 
Are there new abilities, unlockable levels, skill trees, or difficulty scaling? 
-->
- Both players get stronger as the game progresses
- For each rescued survivor, the Rescuer receives an upgrade, and the Infected receives mutations.
- Upgrades include enhancements to combat, defense, mobility, etc.
- Mutations grant passive bonuses or active abilities, either for all zombies or specific units.
- Combat and pacing of the game will escalate as each side unlocks new combat and movement abilities.
  


### Game Rules
<!-- 
Outline the core rules governing the gameplay experience. 
Ensure they are clear, structured, and intuitive. 
-->
Board Setup
- Choose your starting position (either at HQ or through 2 dice rolls) and place your Player Piece on the board
- Deterimine distress call locations with 2 dice rolls and place the Survivor Piece on the board
  - Repeat 2 times for the remaining survivors.
- The board is static with fixed positions for important locations

1. Players start with **!0 Health, 10 Energy, 12 Fuel,**
2.  
3.

Survivors - A diverse range of individuals that the protagonist can encounter when answering a distress call.
