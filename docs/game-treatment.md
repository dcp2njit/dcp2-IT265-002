## Title
- Protocall

A play on the words "Protocol" and "Call". Considering the protagonist of the game is a first-responder trying to rescue survivors sending out distress signals/calls, I felt it made sense to mix the words together to make the title something unique that also fits the theme and Rescuer's objective.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Primary Mechanics

<!-- 
List and describe the core gameplay mechanics players will engage with. 
Explain how they contribute to the game's challenge and fun. 
-->
Turn-Based Asymmetry
- Two-player asymmetric game: One plays the Rescuer, the other controls 3 zombie units (Horde, Stalker, Greaser).
- Turns alternate between players.
- Both sides spend Action Points (AP) to perform actions; AP resets every turn.

Rescuer Mechanics
- 3 AP per turn: used for movement, attacking, using items, or upgrades.
- Health and Energy (10 each) must be maintained; depletion ends the game.
- Loot Inventory: Max 4 cards; consumables aid survival.
- Random Energy Drain: Roll a D6 at end of turn—lose 1 Energy on odds.
- Upgrades: Chosen when rescuing a survivor or returning to HQ.

Infected Mechanics
- Controls 3 unique zombies:
- Horde: Wide reach, custom respawn.
- Stalker: Diagonal moves, wall traversal.
- Greaser: Leaves harmful "greased" tiles, area control.
- Each unit has 2 AP and can use basic attacks and mutation abilities.
- Zombies respawn when killed, but skip a turn on respawn.

Board & Tile Mechanics
- Randomized coordinates for spawning and events using D10s.
- Special tile types:
  - Hazard/Event Tiles: Trigger card effects.
  - Subway/Trainyard Tiles: Fast travel with risk.
  - Distress Signal Tiles: Trigger upgrade/mutation draws.
  - Greased Tiles: Cause damage when exited.
  - Ignited Tiles: Cause instant effects; -1 Health to Rescuer, eliminates Zombies
  - HQ Tile: Deliver survivors and recover resources. Triggers upgrade/mutation draws.

Card Systems
- 5 Card Types:
  - **Loot (20)**: Health, Energy, AP boosts, throwables.
  - **Upgrade (11)**: Passive or active mech abilities.
  - **Mutation (18)**: Unique buffs/actions for zombies.
  - **Hazard (20)**: Random tile-triggered events (mostly negative).
  - **Event (18):** Random tile-triggered events (mostly positive).

Combat & Items
- Rescuer can one-hit kill adjacent zombies (once per turn).
- Items like Molotovs, Shockwaves, and Pipe Bombs offer tactical area control.
- Greaser’s trail and fire can restrict movement or damage units.

### Goals and Challenges
<!-- 
Detail what players aim to achieve and the obstacles they must overcome. 
Explain how these challenges drive player engagement. 

-->
**The Rescuer**

**Objective:** reach each distress signal location and bring 3 survivors back to HQ one at a time. If either resource is depleted before 3 survivors are rescued, the Rescuer fails the mission and loses the game. If the Rescuer manages to bring all 3 survivors back without dying or having their mech run out of Energy they win the game.

**Challenges:** The Rescuer starts with 10 Health and 10 Energy, which they must maintain throughout the entire game. These resources can be lost through combat and hazards, or gained through loot, random encounters, and upgrades. They may lose -1 Energy (determined by a D6 roll) to recharge their mech. Encountered hazards (from tile outcomes) and attacks from the Infected are also challenges that deplete their Health and Energy, which they must consider and adapt their strategy to. Sometimes they will need to make a difficult decision, and other times they have no choice but to deal with what's happening.

**The Infected**

**Objective:** prevent the successful extraction of the survivors by exhausting the Rescuer’s Health or Energy before all 3 are returned to HQ. 

**Challenges:** The Infected has 3 Zombie units to manage and control instead of 1. Instead of having a Health resource, they immediately die upon being attacked by the Rescuer, respawning on their next turn. This can either be a challenge or useful depending on the circumstances and how the Infected chooses to play. 

Both the Rescuer and the Infected will be granted upgrades as the game progresses, which will pose further challenges to each side and escalate the gameplay.




### Progression
<!-- 
Describe how the gameplay evolves over time. 
Are there new abilities, unlockable levels, skill trees, or difficulty scaling? 
-->
- Both players get stronger as the game progresses
- For each rescued survivor, the Rescuer receives an upgrade, and the Infected receives mutations.
- Upgrades include enhancements to combat, defense, mobility, etc.
- Mutations grant passive bonuses or active abilities, either for all zombies or specific units.
- Combat and pacing of the game will escalate as each side unlocks new combat and movement abilities.

## Story and Setting
### Setting
<!-- 
Describe the game world, its rules, and any unique environmental elements. 
Provide enough detail to establish immersion. 
-->
Set in a post-apocalyptic future in a restricted zone in an urban city. It is full of decay, collapsing structures, with hints of life from the overgrowth and survivors that remain.


### Plot
<!-- 
Outline the central narrative arc. 
What is the player’s role in the story, and what major events drive the gameplay forward? 
-->
Distress calls flood the airwaves over the restricted zone--survivors trapped in the infected city remain in desperate need of rescue. As the appointed first responder, you must pilot your mech into the ruins and extract the survivors before it’s too late. However, not only are there countless hazards to be encountered while traversing the city, but there are also hordes of Infected looking to put a halt in your mission. They've broken into the restricted zone and will do anything to take you down and make it their own.

### Characters
<!-- 
List key characters, their roles, and how they impact the story. 
Describe their motivations, personality traits, and influence on the player’s journey. 
-->
Rescuer - A highly-skilled mech pilot appointed as first-responder in the restricted zone's rescue mission. However, they must remain strategic and resourceful with their limited health and mech's stored energy.
Their role is to rescue 3 survivors broadcasting distress signals and return them back to HQ.

Infected: Their role is to halt the Rescuer's mission by depleting their Health and Energy.
- Horde - A general horde of mutated infected that always travels together. They seem to always know where to lurk, which creates a bohtersome presence that applies extra pressure on the Rescure to constantly be on the move.
- Stalker - An agile zombie with a larger range of movement compared to the others. His mutation has granted him incredible agility, allowing him to traverse walls and obstructions by leaping onto or climbing through buildings. His fast movement forces the Rescuer to carefully consider their every move.
- Greaser - A hefty zombie. His mutation has caused him to secrete an excessive amount of toxic grease, leaving behind a toxic trail wherever he roams. His trail punishes careless movement and creates barriers that drain the Resourcer's limited resources.

## Unique Selling Points (USP)
<!-- 
Identify what makes your game stand out from others in its genre. 
Highlight key features that differentiate it in the market. 
-->

It is an asymmetric pvp board game, except the board is isometric!
It combines elements of roguelikes with randomized challenges (card decks, distress signal placement, zombie unit placement) but with static locations (similar to that of Into the Breach), allowing for replayability without setup fatigue considering the fact that it is a physical board game.

## Player Experience Goals
<!-- 
Describe the intended player emotions and reactions. 
Examples: excitement, curiosity, tension, relaxation, humor. 
-->
- **Tension / Sense of urgency** - scarce resources should apply pressure on the Rescuer to make meaningful choices and strategies. The Infected should also feel a sense of urgency to stop the Rescuer before they rescue all 3 survivors, encouraging strategic positioning, movement, and actions.
-** Excitement/Curiousity **- Randomized events, starting positions, and distress call destinations along w/ the flexibility of rules/difficulty ensure unique playthroughs + replayability, enticing players to retry with different strategies to see whether they can play more efficiently in the next run.
- **Satisfaction **- Successfully rescuing all survivors and overcoming hazards and obstacles should feel rewarding to the Rescuer, while successfully stopping the Rescuer in their tracks should feel rewarding to the Infected.
- **Sense of improvement/mastery** - The startegic aspect of the game and emphasis on making smart moves should give players a growing sense of improvement and mastery of the game's mechanics.

## External Feedback
<!-- Duplicate Feedback group as necessary if beyond 3 -->

### Feedback 1
- **Reviewer**:  
  <!-- Enter name and relation to you -->
Seongmin Chang - Gamer friend who likes to learn the intricacies and nuances of the games they play
- **Summary**:  
  <!-- Summarize feedback focusing on concept, mechanics, and style -->
  Seongmin had concerns about the game length, especially in regards to Infected turns. Having 3 units with their own set of abilities and action points might make their turns take too long in comparison to the Rescuer.
- **Refinement**:  
  <!-- Explain how this feedback will improve the design -->
  Taking his feedback into consideration, I made it so that the Infected doesn't have to worry about additional resources to manage aside from just the units themselves. The Rescuer having an extra AP, and tile-based/card-based encounters as well as loot, health, and energy to manage, in theory should make the amount of time put into each turn relatively similar.
