#### Goals for this Module
- [x] Goal 1: Complete Game Treatment
  - [x] Subgoal: Revamp entire board game design from single player to asymmetric pvp  
- [x] Goal 2: Study for Exam
- [X] Goal 3: Complete on Physical Prototype

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
Studied for and did the exam. I wasn't efficient with my time to answer the questions so I had to leave some of them blank/unfinished.
I tried to complete my game treatment checkpoint by the due date, but close to the 10th I received really valuable feedback about the gameplay loop not being fun for a single player. Because of that, I wanted to revamp my entire game to become an asymmetric pvp game for 2 players, to add an extra oppressor and challenge for the protagonist. I spent most of my break redesigning the game, (which i'm scared is a little too complex now)

- **Challenges faced**:
Coming up with a new game design and trying to map out the mechanics and rules took a lot more of my time than I anticipated. It might just be a skill issue honestly, I feel like I shouldn't have struggled as much as I did.
Constant impostor syndrome throughout the process T-T
It's hard for me to feel satisfied with things or decisions I make.

- **Solutions**:
I am trying to manage my time more efficiently (still struggling)
Trying to be kinder to myself and remind myself that this is a learning experience, and it's okay that it won't be perfect.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
Brainstormed game ideas in class and went over the format of the game treatment, game instructions, and creating a physical prototype

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.

As much as I thought the amount of things for the Rescuer to do/encounter made for a good gameplay loop, upon receiving feedback it seems like the gameplay would be too boring for a single player. Although the gameplay isn't too static and allows for variable sessions with replayability, the fact that it is single player might make it difficult to find engaging.

Turning the game into an asymmetric pvp game where the Rescuer now has to worry about the presence of zombies on the board actually working to stop them in their mission, makes the game a lot more tense which is what I initially intended. The inclusion of another player allows for more strategic actions and movements, not just for efficiency. Now each player has to think ahead considering the potential moves of their opponent to consistently stay ahead, making their moves and actions way more meaningful and adding an extra challenge that makes the gameplay more engaging (i hope)

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.

  Try to be more efficient with my time moving forward so that I can submit things in a timely manner.
