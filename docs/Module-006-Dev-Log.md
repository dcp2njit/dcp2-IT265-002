#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - While trying to brainstorm I drew up a concept image of the kind of aesthetic I'd want for the game 2/27/25

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
  - We discussed the inclusion of depth, complexity, and randomness in games, comparing how they each impact the experience of gameplay as well as how games balance them as to not overwhelm players. When utilized correctly, randomness can enhance strategy and make the game more fun and replayable. Balancing depth and complexity can further engage players with meaningful choices and gameplay.
  - We also discussed planning and management when it comes to designing and developing a game, and important stages and concepts to consider throughout the process.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.

  - After looking into it more I think the idea to use Pekwa isn't going to be as viable as I thought it would be, especially since it is typically played with more than 2 players unless I find a way to modify the game rules to make 2 player pekwa make sense. If I were to make AI players, maybe I could make 3?
  - Another card game I started looking into is Spit, which can be played with two players but is more focused on speed rather than strategy.
  - I'll have to think more about this and come to a decision (I'm so indecisive)
  - I was also thinking maybe I could think of something to turn into a board game, but nothing has really come to mind

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
   <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->
  -  Gonna continue brainstorming and filling out the treatment template / final page
  -  Also going to start looking over the concepts we learned as the midterm date is approaching
